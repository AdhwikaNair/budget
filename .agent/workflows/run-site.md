description: How to run the Life Simulator website
---

To run the Life Simulator website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Open your terminal in the project root and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**
   Run the following command to start the Vite development server:
   // turbo
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **View the Website**
   Once the server is running, the terminal will show a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). 
   - Open your browser and navigate to that address.
   - Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the page.

4. **Build for Production** (Optional)
   To create a production-ready build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
